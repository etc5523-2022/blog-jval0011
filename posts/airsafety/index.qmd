Seeing news about flight accidents, airplane crashed, does it make you question airline safety? Does it make you afraid to fly? Regardless of the major flight incidents happened, according to a study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT), flying on commercial airlines actually has never been safer [@dizikes_2020]. The study has found that the passenger fatalities has been decreasing, even for the long term. 

> “The worldwide risk of being killed had been dropping by a factor of two every decade,” - [barnett_2020] 

In this article, we will dive into past airlines performance, analyse and answer the question : "Have airline safety really improved these past decades?" 

## About the data

The data for this article is sourced from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-08-07), which has been modified from the original data by [Aviation Safety Network](https://aviation-safety.net/).

The data contains `r dim(air_data)[1]` observations and `r dim(air_data)[2]` variables. 

```{r variable}
tibble(
  "Variable" = colnames(air_data),
  "Class" = c("integer", "character", "double",
              "character","character","integer"),
  "Description" = c("Number of observations",
                    "Airline (asterisk indicates that regional subsidiaries are included)",
                    "Available seat kilometers flown every week",
                    "Range of year (1985-1999 & 2000-2014)",
                    "Types of events happened : incidents, fatal accidents, fatalities",
                    "Total number of event that happened"
                   )) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
  
```

## Analysis

```{r}
air <- air_data%>%
  select(-X) %>%
  mutate(airline = str_replace(airline,"\\*",""),
         year_range = factor(year_range, levels=c("85_99", "00_14")),
         n_events = as.numeric(n_events),
         type_of_event = str_replace(type_of_event, "\\_", " ")) %>%
  mutate(type_of_event = factor(type_of_event, 
                                levels = c("incidents", "fatal accidents", "fatalities")))
```


```{r}
#| label: tbl-diff
#| tbl-cap: Average number of incidents, fatal accidents and fatalities had decreased, comparing both range of years.  

air %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_range,
              values_from = n_events) %>%
  group_by(type_of_event) %>%
  summarise(avg85_99 = mean(`85_99`, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg00_14 = mean(`00_14`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(diff = (avg00_14 - avg85_99)/avg85_99 * 100) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Type of event", "1985-1999", "2000-2014", "Difference(%)"), align = "lrrr",
        caption = "Average number of incidents",
        digits = 3) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

From the @tbl-diff below we can see that on average airlines has become more safe as the number of incidents, fatal accidents and fatalities had decreased. 

```{r}
air_wide <- air %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(year_range, type_of_event),
              values_from = n_events) %>%
  rename("incidents1" = "85_99_incidents",
         "fatal_accidents1" = "85_99_fatal accidents",
         "fatalities1" = "85_99_fatalities",
         "incidents2" = "00_14_incidents",
         "fatal_accidents2" = "00_14_fatal accidents",
         "fatalities2" = "00_14_fatalities"
        ) %>%
  mutate(tot_inc = incidents1 + incidents2,
         tot_fac = fatal_accidents1 + fatal_accidents2,
         tot_fat = fatalities1 + fatalities2)
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-inc
#| fig-cap: Top 10 airlines with the highest number of incidents in 1985-99 and 2000-14

my_colors <- c("#B5EAD7", "#C7CEEA", "#FF9AA2", "#C1E3FE")
common_air <- c("Delta / Northwest", "American", 
                     "United / Continental", "US Airways / America West")
names(my_colors) = common_air


p1 <- air_wide %>%
  top_n(10, incidents1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidents1,
            y = reorder(airline, incidents1, max))) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, airline %in% common_air),
             fill = my_colors) +
  labs(y = "",
       x = "Number of Incidents",
       title = "1985 - 1999") +
  geom_text(aes(label = incidents1),
            hjust = 0, nudge_x = -9, color = "black", size = 5)


p2 <-air_wide %>%
  top_n(10, incidents2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidents2,
            y = fct_reorder(airline, incidents2, max))) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, airline %in% common_air),
             fill = my_colors) +
  labs(y = "",

       title = "2000 - 2014") +
  geom_text(aes(label = incidents2),
            hjust = 0, nudge_x = -3, color = "black", size = 5)

p1 + p2
```

From the @fig-inc we can see








```{r}
avg_fat <- air %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_range,
              values_from = n_events) %>%
  filter(type_of_event == "fatalities") %>%
  mutate(fat_8599 = `85_99` / avail_seat_km_per_week,
         fat_0014 = `00_14` / avail_seat_km_per_week)

avg_fat %>%
  summarise(avg_fat8599 = mean(`fat_8599`, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000000,
            avg_fat0014 = mean(`fat_0014`, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000000) %>%
  mutate(diff = (avg_fat0014-avg_fat8599) / avg_fat8599 * 100) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("1985-1999", "2000-2014", "Difference (%)"), align = "rrr",
        caption = "Average number of fatalities in 10 million seats",
        digits = 3) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")
                ,position = "right")
  
```

```{r}

p4 <- avg_fat %>%

             y = fat_8599,
             label = airline)) +
